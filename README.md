# ML
This repository contains multiple beginner-to-intermediate level Machine Learning projects, implemented using Python and Google Colab. Each project demonstrates how ML techniques can be applied to solve real-world problems in healthcare, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.

**Projects Included**
**1. Diabetes Prediction**

File: Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb

Description: Predicts whether a patient has diabetes based on health parameters (like glucose level, BMI, age, etc.).

Techniques Used: Logistic Regression, Data Preprocessing, Accuracy Evaluation.

**2. Heart Disease Prediction**

File: Heart_Disease_ML.ipynb

Description: Predicts the presence of heart disease in patients using medical features (cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.).

Techniques Used: Classification Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).

**3. Movie Recommendation System**

File: Movie_Recommendation_System_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb

Description: Recommends movies to users based on their preferences.

Techniques Used: Content-Based Filtering, Similarity Measures (Cosine Similarity).

**4. Spam Mail Prediction**

File: Spam_Mail_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb

Description: Detects whether an email is spam or not using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Techniques Used: TF-IDF, Naive Bayes Classifier, Text Preprocessing.

**Tech Stack**
